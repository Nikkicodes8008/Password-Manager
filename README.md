# Password-Manager
This is free terminal based password manager program I wrote in Python 
The program uses Random library to help generate a random password 
The program uses json library to perform operations on JSON files 
The program utilizes string library to easily access different characters 
The program uses pathlib library to dynamically find path to the folder in which the python file is present this is done to improve portability 
The project reflects on my learning journey of Python as a self thougt programer
